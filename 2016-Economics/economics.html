</div>

<h2>inflation</h2>

<h2>interest</h2>
<div>
	<p>a share, right, or title in the ownership of property, in a commercial or financial undertaking</p>
	<p>example:putting money into a bank, and then letting that money sit there, which gains you money from the bank... well, not the bank, the idiots who think they can take a loan without going bankrupt.</p>
